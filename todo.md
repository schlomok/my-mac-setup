TODO
====

-   \[ \] Fix up README to include links and rationale for installs.
-   \[ \] Create cronjobs for automating updating of multiple apps
-   \[ \] Automate configuration for several applications
-   \[ \] Include parameters to allow my installation of specific types
    of applications, or different setups
    -   For example, my setup for a lightweight desktop, a functionally
        ready Java development environment, a web development
        environment, or all of the above! By default, it will
        include everything.

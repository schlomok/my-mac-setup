# My Personal Mac OS X Setup

### Installation

Run the following commands to install the complete setup.

    sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlomok/my-mac-setup/master/install.sh)"

### What's In It

So far - nothing!

### TODO

* [ ] Include my dotfiles
* [ ] Include installation of all apps I use
* [ ] Create cronjobs for automating updating of multiple apps
* [ ] Include parameters to allow my installation of specific types of applications, or different
      setups
    - For example, my setup for a lightweight desktop, a functionally ready Java development 
      environment, a web development environment, or all of the above! By default, it will include
      everything.
